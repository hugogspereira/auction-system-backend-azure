First run 

```
npm install
```

on your terminal to install all the required node modules.

Secondly, you can simply run the scripts from the package.json, if you're using VS Code, or you can type into your terminal 

```
npm run [TEST]
```

where [TEST] is the filename of the yml file you wish to run.

Please check the scripts in package.json, since there are now scripts that allow you to run several tests in series.
